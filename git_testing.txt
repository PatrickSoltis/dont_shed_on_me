Use this file for warming up with Github commands, if you need it!

If you want to practice safely removing things:
Get rid of this line!
Or this one.

Create a new branch for every set of changes you make.
Branches will be merged in the browser, logged into Github directly.
If you need to make additional changes but a previous branch has not yet been merged, create a branch off that branch.
